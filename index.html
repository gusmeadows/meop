					# 1. Let Me Live
					A little request to all  
					pause, stay for once  
					rest restlessness, calm calmlesness  
					and listen-listen not me,  
					my soul, listen the chorus instead
					</section >
					<section data-markdown>
					"let me live-live as myself  
					be-be myself, feel-feel myself  
					and freeze-freeze the worries  
					Ice-Ice let it be  
					Never it melts,ever be me  
					only me, only me  
					</section >
					<section data-markdown>
					I imagine walls,     
					being broken    
					the shrewdness,   
					being smoked    
					ununderstanding,  
					be understood  
					and once for all,  
					me being me  
					</section >
					<section data-markdown>
					me being me, even my reflection  
					for I don't know my reflection  
					how they feel about my intention  
					for me, if you ask  
					for me, I am good  
					not that my heart, soul is clean   
					baptized, rather just not stained    
					stained so much to cover the whole  
					</section >
					<section data-markdown>
					so I wannna imagine  
					imagine the walls bring broken  
					me being me even my reflection  
					imagine everyone called the truth  
					the truth, that's far always  
					</section >
					<section data-markdown>
					now that you heard  
					let it be so  
					let it be so, let me live"

				even if a whisper  you hear  
				if you do then
